# Frontend Mentor – Product Preview Card Component

This was one of my very first mini projects using HTML and CSS. It's a solution to the [Product Preview Card Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/html-css-grid-and-flex-yTNOrErleh)) on Frontend Mentor.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal was to build a responsive product card layout with an image, product details, and a call-to-action button. I practiced using both **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** to structure the layout.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to combine Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Writing mobile-first responsive design with `@media` queries
- Challenges with image resizing and preserving proportions between desktop and mobile

> I struggled with keeping the image intact when resizing below 800px — something I’d like to revisit and improve later.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS (Grid + Flexbox)
- Media queries for responsiveness
